# Python Rock-Scissors-Paper Game (Utilizing OpenCV)

This repository hosts the codebase for a simple Rock-Scissors-Paper game developed in Python, leveraging the OpenCV library. The project employs OpenCV's image processing capabilities to recognize player's hand gestures (Rock, Scissors, or Paper) via a webcam feed.

## Features

- **Hand Gesture Recognition:** Implements OpenCV, potentially in conjunction with the MediaPipe library, to perform real-time detection and classification of hand gestures corresponding to Rock, Scissors, and Paper from a webcam stream.
- **Automated Opponent:** Enables gameplay against a virtual opponent (computer) employing a pseudo-random selection mechanism.
- **Result Visualization:** Displays both the player's and the computer's selections, along with the outcome of each round.
- **Basic Graphical Interface:** A rudimentary graphical interface may be constructed using OpenCV functionalities or integrated with external GUI libraries, contingent on further development.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/paht2005/PythonGame_Rock-Scissors-Paper.git](https://github.com/paht2005/PythonGame_Rock-Scissors-Paper.git)
    cd PythonGame_Rock-Scissors-Paper
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Utilize pip to install the necessary libraries specified in the `SetUp.txt` file:
    ```bash
    pip install -r SetUp.txt
    ```
    Alternatively, install them individually:
    ```bash
    pip install mediapipe
    pip install opencv-python
    ```

3.  **(Optional) Jupyter Notebook:**
    To execute the `.ipynb` file, ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed:
    ```bash
    pip install notebook
    # or
    pip install jupyterlab
    ```
---
## Usage
1.  **Execute the Game:**
    - If using Jupyter Notebook, open the `GoogleColabProject_RockScissorsPaper_Game.ipynb` file and execute the code cells sequentially.
    - If the project is developed as a standalone Python script (`.py`), run it from the terminal:
      ```bash
      python your_game_script.py
      ```

2.  **Follow On-screen Prompts:**
    - The application may request access to your webcam to capture video frames for gesture recognition.
    - Present hand gestures corresponding to Rock, Scissors, or Paper when prompted.
    - The outcome of each round will be displayed on the interface.
